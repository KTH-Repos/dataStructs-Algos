##Note to TA

The insertion sort methods in BoxProcessor are not working
correctly as they omit Box objects in either the first or
last index after sorting. But they all passed the
tests in BoxProcessorTest

sequentialSearchFindsAllElementsInArray and 
sequentialSearchFindsAllElementsInList are testing
methods in BoxProcessorTest that I myself coded. I am
not entirely sure if I wrote the code correctly eventhough
they both work.
